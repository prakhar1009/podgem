male-1: So, today we're looking at the resume of Prakhar Mishra, quite the impressive profile here. Looks like he's a Computer Science student.
female-1: Oh, cool! What stands out to you immediately?
male-1: Well, right off the bat, the projects section. He's got two interesting projects listed: one called "SlideMind - AI-Powered Presentation Builder" and another "AI-Based Ticket Scalping Detection System." Sounds pretty advanced, right?
female-1: Definitely! "SlideMind"… an AI presentation builder? Hmmm, tell me more. How does that even work?
male-1: From what I can see here, it uses React.js, Google Gemini API, and some other libraries. Basically, it's designed to create professional-looking slide decks in minutes, based on what the user inputs – you know, the topic, who's the audience, the overall tone they're going for.
female-1: Wow, that's actually really useful. I always struggle with making presentations. So, does it like, write the content too, or just format it nicely?
male-1: It seems like it does both! It integrates the Google Gemini API to actually generate slide content *and* speaker notes. It uses natural language processing to tailor it for impactful storytelling.
female-1: That’s wild. So, you could just give it a topic and it would write your presentation for you? Like magic!
male-1: Pretty much! And it supports exporting to PPTX and PDF, so you can save and load presentations, customize the design... all that good stuff. He even deployed it on Netlify for global accessibility.
female-1: Netlify, gotcha. Okay, that sounds seriously impressive. What about this ticket scalping detection system? That sounds like it could be controversial.
male-1: Ha! Yeah, well, it uses Python, Gradio, and Pandas. It’s designed to detect and prevent ticket scalping by analyzing user behavior – things like IP patterns, transaction speed, and even KYC verification data.
female-1: KYC? Know Your Customer? So, it's digging deep.
male-1: Exactly. It's a multi-module AI system. It also integrates modules for dynamic ticket pricing, resale compliance checks, and admin reporting. The aim is to ensure fair access and pricing for real users.
female-1: So, trying to stop bots and scalpers from buying up all the tickets and reselling them at crazy prices. Makes sense.
male-1: Yep. And he developed a user-friendly Gradio interface for interactive demo deployment and use-case simulation. He also deployed it on Hugging Face Spaces for testing.
female-1: Hugging Face, that's a big name in AI, right? So, this guy knows his stuff.
male-1: Seems like it! Plus, he has certifications from IBM in Generative AI, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and Front End Development.
female-1: Okay, so definitely solid AI credentials then. What about his general tech skills?
male-1: Lists Javascript, Python, C, HTML, CSS, and Flask under Languages and Frameworks. For Developer Tools and Platforms, he mentions Git, Github, and Hugging Face. So, a good, solid full-stack skillset.
female-1: Definitely a good mix. Anything on soft skills? Those are important too, you know.
male-1: Absolutely! He lists Leadership, Communication, Problem Solving, Innovation, and Adaptability. The usual suspects, but important ones. It shows he’s aware of the non-technical aspects of the job.
female-1: Yeah, you can be the best coder in the world, but if you can't communicate or work in a team, you're going to struggle. This guy seems to have a good balance. When is he expected to graduate?
male-1: Expected 2026, so still has some time left in school. Imagine what he'll accomplish by then! The fact that he's already building AI-powered tools to generate presentations and fight ticket scalpers is really something.
female-1: Absolutely. It sounds like he's using AI to solve real-world problems, which is exactly what companies are looking for. Plus, the presentation builder is actually something *I* could use! Hah!
male-1: Exactly! It shows initiative, problem-solving skills, and a good understanding of current technologies. The combination of AI skills with front-end and back-end development knowledge is a huge plus.
female-1: Well, Prakhar Mishra, if you're listening, consider this our official endorsement! This resume is impressive.
male-1: Couldn't agree more! Definitely someone to watch out for in the future.
